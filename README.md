Overview
This is a simple Contact Management System implemented in C++ using a Binary Search Tree (BST). The system allows users to manage contacts by providing options to add, search, delete, and display contacts. The contacts are stored in a binary search tree (BST), where each node holds information about a contact (name, phone, and email).

Features
Add Contact: Allows users to add new contacts with a name, phone number, and email address.
Search Contact: Enables users to search for a contact by name.
Delete Contact: Allows users to delete a contact by name.
Display Contacts: Displays all contacts in the system, sorted by name.
Exit: Exits the system.
Requirements
C++ Compiler (such as GCC or Clang)
